          <h2>Nearby Places To Visit In <b>Varkala</b></h2>
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-01">
							   <h3>Varkala Cliff</h3>
<p>Walk your way through paved sea side road to Varkala, a small temple city and
a renowned spiritual center of Hindus. </p>
			  
			  <p>Varkala is also a famous tourist spot
known for its collection of shops selling trinkets, handicrafts and
everything spiritual
that is quintessentially Indian. It also has a number of
lovely restaurants specializing in seafood. Varkala has a panoramic
beach leading abruptly into the majestic and world famous Varkala cliff with its
sheer red sandstone peeping out. One of the 
enduring attractions of Varkala
is the Janardhana Swami temple which is around 2,000 years old and
functioning through the millennia 
to this day.</p>
				
				<p>Our guests typically settle into a heady rhythm of daily relaxing yoga and
Ayurveda followed by a trip to bustling spiritual
Varkala only to come back
to the serenity of Kadaltheeram for a delightful dinner and rest.</p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			
			
          <div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-1">
							   <h3>Sivagiri Mutt</h3>
<p>The hilly and quaint reaches of Varkala are home to one among the holiest sites in all of God's Own Country, the Sivagiri Mutt. Here lies the headquarters of the SreeNarayana Dharma Sangham, an organisation built by Sree Narayana Guru's disciples and followers, honouring one among the world's finest social reformers and crusader for justice. Spread over 200 acres, its location on an elevated plateau, along with the very structure and functioning of the place, has provided spiritual succour to thousands of people over the years.</p>
			  
			  <p>It is said that SreeNarayana Guru himself fell in love with the overall ambience at Varkala and decided to build a hermitage atop the Sivagri Hill. This is where the pilgrim centre we see today lies, and it also has the Samadhi of the Guru. The Guru set up an elementary school here, inviting people across caste lines. He built a new temple at the site and dedicated it to the Goddess of Knowledge, Saraswathi. Thus, the Saradha (Saraswathi) Temple here came into being in 1912.</p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-2">
							   <h3>Papanasham Beach</h3>
<p>The silvery stretches of sand and the calm ambience on the beaches are the highlights of Varkala as a tourist destination. 'Papanasam' is one of the main beaches here and it is not only an important tourist spot but it also has religious significance. It is believed that a dip in the waters here will wash away all the sins (papam) and hence the beach obtained its name. Hindus find it a very auspicious place and ashes collected from the cremation grounds are immersed at the sea here. They believe that the sins of the deceased will be washed away and the soul gets moksha or eternal salvation through this ritual.</p>
			  
				<span>Ambience at the beach</span>
				
			  <p>Adjacent to the white sandy beaches are the pink laterite cliffs, which stand there like sentinels guarding the sea. The cliffs surround the beach and it is the ideal getaway for anyone who wants to escape from the hullabaloo of the urban life. Bordered by coconut palms and blessed with an idyllic serenity, the beach has a laid back ambience and it is often a traveller’s pleasure and rejuvenation point. You can collect sea shells; take a stroll on the sand enjoying the unending stretch of blue waters or lie down on the laid back sun kissed beach. It is the ideal spot for a sunbath or for a perfect view of sunset. The golden orange on the sky after the sunset will surely make you bow before the greatest artist, Nature.  The outline of the fishing boats that appear on the horizon in this golden yellow background will surely spur the artist in you. </p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-3">
							   <h3>Janardhana Swamy Temple</h3>
<p>One of the ancient temples in Kerala, the Janardhana temple is a major pilgrim spot in Varkala. The temple, which has a history of some 2000 years, is located on a steep hill, at the entrance of the beach road.</p>
			  
				<span>Ambience and architecture</span>
				
			  <p>Varkala Janrdhanaswami Temple is popular not only as a pilgrim centre but it also allures everyone with its architectural splendour.  The temple faces Papanasam beach and the proximity to the sea adds to its spiritual as well as aesthetic aura. A flight of broad steps lead to the Janardhana temple and on the way, you will be greeted by a high entrance arch with tiled roof. An old banyan tree stands on the temple ground and idols of several serpent gods and goddesses are also installed here.</p>
				
				<p>Brightly painted idols of  Hanuman, Garuda, Lord Shiva and others greet you once you are about to enter the sanctorum. The main shrine Lord Janardhana (Vishnu) has four arms in which are placed shanghu (the holy conch shell) chakra (wheel), gada (mace) and kumbham (pot).</p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-4">
							   <h3>Edava Beach</h3>
<p>Set along the shoreline of the Arabian Sea, Edava Beach is a well-known travel attraction in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. This beach is located in the coastal town of the same name. Calling it nature’s bounty won’t be wrong as it is blest with the beauty of nature in profusion. The virgin sands of this beach are hemmed in the towering palm trees and its ambiance is simply spellbinding. One should pay a visit to this beach during their expedition to Kerala.</p>
			  
				<span>It Is Known For:-</span>
				
			  <p>The historical warehouse that was built in British India in the 17th century</p>
				<p>The nearby lakes where one can succumb to nature and reinvigorate their senses</p>
				<p>Occasional beach parties during New Year's Eve</p>
				
				
				<span>Best Time To Visit:-</span>
				
				<p>Due to its geography, the beach and the area nearby doesn't get humid. This results in the pleasant weather that makes it comfortable for the holidaymakers to spend more time at the beach. However, the scorching heat during June plays a baddie and makes it the month to be booed. Strolling on the beach during the sunrise is an experience in itself. Do not miss it.</p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-5">
							   <h3>Kappil Beach</h3>
<p>The pristine Kappil Beach and backwaters is situated 7 km away from Varkala, the famed beach destination. The ideal blend of the backwaters and sea, itoffers an idyllic escape from the world. Located close to the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram, people come here to enjoy the scenic backwaters and the various water sports options. It is a peaceful area with ample chances to simply relax or take a comforting boat ride. The Kodi Hills nearby offers a breath-taking view that is sure the capture the hearts of all those who make the trek up the cliff. A drive along the coastal road is also a delightful way to experience the delightful view.</p>

			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-6">
							   <h3>Kappil Lake/ Estuary: (Pozhikkara)</h3>
<p>About 7.5 kilometers north of Varkala town and hardly 2 kilometers from Kadaltheeram is the serene and scenic Kappil Lake. Bordered with coconut groves and trees, this tranquil estuary roves gracefully and merges into the Arabian Sea. Get on the bridge that is built across the lake and you will get the most fascinating view of the lake pacing toward the blue horizon.  Kappil beach is the meeting point of Kappil Lake and Arabian Sea.</p>
			  
							  </div>
			
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-7">
							   <h3>Anjengo Fort & Anjengo Light House</h3>
<p>Located about 7 km from Varkala, and lying on the Arabian sea coastline is Anjengo or Anjuthengu, meaning five coconut trees. A place of historic significance tagged to Anjengo comes through foreign powers like the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the English East India Company. In the year 1684, the English East India Company chose Anjengo to establish their first trade settlement in Kerala. There is also a cemetery inside the fort, which most probably would be having the remains of the occupants of the fort, and the oldest among the burial sites dates to 1704.</p>
			  
				<p>Anjengo is a set amidst a beautiful fishing hamlet. The lighthouse near the fort is around 130-feet tall and 183 steps to climb, it offers quite a view. If you are in Varkala, this place is certainly worth a visit!</p>
							  </div>
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-8">
							   <h3>Golden Island / Ponnumthuruth Island</h3>
<p>Ponnumthuruthu is a backwater island which is situated about 12km south of Varkala. You can board a country boat from Nedunganda and take a scenic tour through the backwaters for about 30 minutes to reach Ponnumthuruthu. </p>
			  
				<p>Ponnumthuruthu, the name literally means Golden Island. Legend says that the queens of Travancore Royal Family used to hide their cache of gold and ornaments on the island in order to keep it safe and hence it obtained the name, Ponnumthuruthu. </p>
							  </div>
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-9">
							   <h3>Temple in the island</h3>
<p>This island is known for the Shiva Parvathi temple, which is also called `Thuruthu kshethram’ by the natives. The temple is situated amidst thick coconut groves, which covers the entire stretch. The temple is more than 100 years old and the entire island is temple property. The temple was in ruins for a long time but about a decade ago, it was rebuilt.</p>
							  </div>
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-10">
							   <h3>Ambience at the island</h3>
<p>The island is a must see, thanks to the enchanting ambience. Even the jetty at Nedunganda village from where the journey to Ponnumthuruthu start, stands out. It is a makeshift jetty and the walkway to the ferry is made up of a unique mix of  coconut husk, mud and the waste from coir.  
A view of the island from the ferry in the evening will soothe any nature-lover’s mind. The greenery of the island sports a distinctive glow when the setting rays of the sun caress it. 
</p>
				
				<p>The island is also a haven of different types of flora and fauna. It is a bird watcher’s delight to visit the island, thanks to the cormorants, egrets and herons seen in this area. Eagles and gulls too can be found here. Various other water birds can be seen here too.  </p>

<p>The mainland on the other side of Ponnumthuruthu is a coir village. A coir village is a cottage industry set in a village which manufactures coir products mostly using traditional manual methods. There is a small coir-making unit near the ferry. Travellers can visit the unit. It is a unique experience  to watch the boats carrying husks sliding through the backwaters to reach the island.
</p>
				
							  </div>
			
			
			
			<div class="travel-box recipe-section" id="place-11">
							   <h3>Munroe Island</h3>
<p>This is an island surrounded by Kallada River and the Astamudi Lake. The island is also known as Munrothuruthu. The strip is one of the most picturesque villages in Kerala and is blessed with a number of crisscrossing canals and zigzagging water ways. The island plays host to many migratory birds. Coir making as a cottage industry is an added attraction.</p>

It has a wonderful view over the plant to the sea, also an air conditioning is available if you wish. My stay was made even more pleasant.</p>

				    		<p>It was my 4th visit to Kadaltheeram for a very good and sustainable Ayurveda cure. I am simply thrilled with the result of this cure. Thanks to a very experienced and super nice Dr. Manu and his wife Smitha I got again an Ayurveda cure that has greatly increased my health. I highly recommend this doctor, be it in competence and friendliness and, of course, in the tailored treatments and medication. The result is fantastic and I feel reborn. Worth mentioning is of course the great ayurvedic kitchen which a very nice chef prepares there. It all tastes good even if you're not a die-hard vegetarian. The management with hashim at the top takes care of the concerns of their guests in a very friendly and timely manner. And of course (in my case) the two Ayurveda therapists who understand their craft excellently and are simply a well-rehearsed team. You can feel it with every treatment. This is where the old therapy rule comes in: an application is at the same time an affection to the patient or guest. All in all a very successful cure in Kadaltheeram. With one sentence: food, applications, rooms, doctor - all succeeded. It goes without saying that one does not descend into a luxury shed, but has the focus on health and well-being. Thank you Manu, thank you Kadaltheeram. I'll be back for sure.</p>
